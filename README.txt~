  This is a template README file about how you should form your own README file.
  In general,
        you should remove anything in between square brackets (i.e. [..]), and
        you should replace anything in between <> with a value.

PURPOSE:

To decrypt text documents encrypted by a caesar cipher using multiple threads.

PERCENT COMPLETE:

[
We believe we have completed 100% of this project.

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:

No parts are incomplete.

BUGS:

There are no bugs.

FILES:

  Included with this project are 11 files:

  CaesarCipherI.java, The interface defining how to interact with CaesarDectypt
  CaesarDecrypt.java, The model that actually decrypts strings encoded with the caesar cipher
  CreateWorkers.java, Creates the threads that will decrypt strings
  ThreadedDecrypter.java, Defines what how one of these threads will behave
  Driver.java, Interfaces with the user and uses our model
  DecodedStore.java, Handles storing the decoded texts and writing them to a file
  DisplayI.java, Defines how to interact with DecodedStore
  FileProcessor.java, Handles reading a given file line by line
  Logger.java, Defines functionality that helps debug threaded code
  Build.xml, the ANT build file containing the arguments necessary to print the file
  README, the text file you are presently reading

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

[
  Copy and paste a recent CORRECT output from your test runs, ALONG with the
  command line. Cut it short if more than 10 lines. Here is a sample:

  [erdil@the_caribbean:~erdil]$ ./a.out topaz 12345 binaenaleyh
  SOME OUTPUT
  SOME MORE
  WOW, IT DOES NOT END
  [snip here] (-> if too long)
  OH MY..
  FINALLY
  [erdil@the_caribbean:~erdil]$
]

TO COMPILE:

[
  Document here how your TA can build your program after extracting your
  gzipped-tarball. (Note: ideally, TA should just do a "make". Justify extra
  steps needed). Be as clear as possible, refer to "... FOR DUMMIES" book
  format. Assume your TA is completely lost, trying to save the universe.
  Here is a sample:

  Just extract the files and then do a "make".
]

TO RUN:

[
  Document here how your TA can test your program after extracting your gzipped-
  tarball. Be as clear as possible, refer to "... FOR DUMMIES" book format.
  Assume your TA is completely lost, there is another universe. Here is a
  sample:

  Please run as: ./a.out <REGHOST> <REGPORT> <UNIQNAME>
  For example:   ./a.out topaz 12345 binaenaleyh

EXTRA CREDIT:

[
  Document here extra work you have done to get bonus grade, IF THERE IS ANY.
  Otherwise, say "N/A"
